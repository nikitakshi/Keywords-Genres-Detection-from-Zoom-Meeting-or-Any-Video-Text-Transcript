# Keywords-Genres-Detection-from-Zoom-Meeting-or-Any-Video-Text-Transcript
# Overview
This project aims to transcribe video content from Zoom meetings or any video source, extract keywords using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and predict the genre based on the content. It provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing video content and extracting valuable information.

# Features
Video Transcription: Converts video content into text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and video processing techniques.
Keyword Extraction: Utilizes NLP techniques, such as TF-IDF, to extract relevant keywords from the transcribed text.
Genre Prediction: Predicts the genre of the content using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.
Technologies Used
SpeechRecognition
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
scikit-learn
moviepy
Flask (Web Application Framework)
OpenAI GPT-3 API
Streamlit (Interactive Web Apps)
FFmpeg (Video Processing)
Usage
Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Structure
The project is organized into the following components:

 Data Processing:

 Preprocessing of text data to remove noise and irrelevant information.
Keyword Detection:

 Implementation of algorithms to identify and extract keywords from the text.
Genre Classification:

 Development of a model to classify content into genres based on identified keywords.
Documentation:

 README file describing the project, its components, and usage instructions.
 Additional documentation for code comments and project structure.
