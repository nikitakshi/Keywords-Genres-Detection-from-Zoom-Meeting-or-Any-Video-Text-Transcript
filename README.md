# Keywords-Genres-Detection-from-Zoom-Meeting-or-Any-Video-Text-Transcript

## Overview

This project aims to transcribe video content from Zoom meetings or any video source, extract keywords using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and predict the genre based on the content. It provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing video content and extracting valuable information.

## Features

- **Video Transcription:** Converts video content into text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and video processing techniques.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Utilizes NLP techniques, such as TF-IDF, to extract relevant keywords from the transcribed text.
- **Genre Prediction:** Predicts the genre of the content using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.

## Technologies Used

- SpeechRecognition
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- scikit-learn
- moviepy
- Flask (Web Application Framework)
- OpenAI GPT-3 API
- Streamlit (Interactive Web Apps)
- FFmpeg (Video Processing)

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

1. **Data Processing:**
   - [ ] Text transcript extraction from Zoom meetings or video content.
   - [ ] Preprocessing of text data to remove noise and irrelevant information.

2. **Keyword Detection:**
   - [ ] Implementation of algorithms to identify and extract keywords from the text.

3. **Genre Classification:**
   - [ ] Development of a model to classify content into genres based on identified keywords.

4. **Documentation:**
   - [ ] README file describing the project, its components, and usage instructions.
   - [ ] Additional documentation for code comments and project structure.
